# Application Description

I created a server.js file and pulled all my data from github that I was able to store into json files using fs. I then went and created an index.js that would utilize this json data on the front end. This became a much quicker way to create this program as I only need to pull and store data a single time for it to showcase my stats.

Using javascript I and graph.js, I then created a site that would show the languages used and the percentage they are used per project.

For the future, I will showcase total bytes that exist on github and what percentage of bytes exist in each project!

I love to code!
