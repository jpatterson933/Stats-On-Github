# Application Description

This page will show you the language usage stats for each one of my repositories on github. 

Last Updated: 7/13/22 - Updates will take place randomly.

I created a server.js file and pulled all my data from github that I was able to store into json files using fs. I then went and created an index.js that would utilize this json data on the front end. This became a much quicker way to create this program as I only need to pull and store data a single time for it to showcase my stats.

Using javascript I and graph.js, I then created a site that would show the languages used and the percentage they are used per project.

I originally wanted to do an API request every single time a button was clicked but this turned out to be extremely slow. Storing and using JSON data was something I had always wanted to learn to do as I knew it was a quicker method then API calls but I never knew how to do it until this project!

I love to code!
